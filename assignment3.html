Activity 1:
In the first article, it talks about how to search online, and also introduces some universal features of a browser, such as a search bar, bookmark/favorite, and reading a webpage. One interesting thing is how one of the images states that "The web isn't MAGIC", and when I searched up the complex question examples that was given, Google completely understood the sentence. That's a fairly interesting feat and probably was done for more user friendliness. I also never knew that Google had an option for an advanced search, but I guess the main reason why I didn't know about it was because it was tucked away behind the "More" option, and the fact that Google was already accurate with what giving the results that I needed. The Google Fast Facts image was also fairly interesting, as I have certainly used conversions (for example, pounds to kilogram), converting currency, and whatnot. But I have never thought that it could also do equations, get the sunrise/sunset times, or even get tracking information about packages. The article also talked about cross identifying whether or not the websites has accurate or true information. It's still interesting how from the time of writing the article to present day, the Wikipedia link to the "unreliable" page is still not ideal. 
The second article talks about search engines. The search engine is broken down into 3 components: Web crawlers, database, and the search interface. To me, it seems fairly interesting on how websites can first be "identified" as an actual website by web crawlers. After all, there's so much possibilities on what domain name a website could have. Alongside that, the database to store website information is most likely a huge amount of space, probably taking more than several petabytes amount of space. 

Activity 2:
Activity 2 looks into comparing search engines, like Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Ask. I have certainly heard of Yahoo when I was very young, and occasionally I also come across Bing as well, though it's mainly when I accidentally press something on Windows 10. I had never heard of the Ask search engine before, however. One interesting observation from Google and Ask is that the page is littered with search ads. I'd assume that there's a lot of money to be made from making a search engine, though at least 1/4th of the page were search ads, which is the most that I had ever seen. The first three results of Yahoo's search engine was articles that labelled the top or alternative search engines. Though after that, it shows actual search engines. Bing is fairly interesting, as it has its own search bar inside of its page. When I looked up the search engine market share on Google, the first result was surprising. Google supposedly had over 92% of the search engine market share. To me, it seems like a no brainer that Google had one of the most popular search engines and browser, but for Google to dominate more than 9/10th of the search engine market share is just astounding. This makes me wonder about how much money search engines make, as it's probably very hefty to maintain both a large database, and hosting the search engine at a moment's notice to probably millions of people. 

Activity 3:
Activity 3 looks into search operators. The first exact phrases felt as if it had no differences on the front page whatsoever, containing the same results. However, the description of the result had different things highlighted, and the search had a vastly smaller amount of search results. Though personally, as far as I'm concerned, there wasn't much of a difference as I only tend to look at the front page of a search engine. Searching in a specific site was also fairly interesting, though there's probably no reason to not assume that the site itself has the "better" search function, as it also displayed things like last modified, what the article is a parent to, and whatnot. I had never used the site: funciton, but I don't think that I would use it extensively, especially if the website has a built in search as well. When I looked up for SEO, one of the surprising things that I had saw was that Google themselves wrote an article about improving the SEO. When I looked at the other two articles, it was clear that they were here to sell a product, which was to improve the SEO of a website. Although it doesn't make them unqualified or unfit, it's interesting how Google's resources was on top of the results.
