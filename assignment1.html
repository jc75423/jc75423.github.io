Activity 3:
The first two articles talk about how to modify, rename, change, or move files within the Windows and MacOS systems. It goes into using preset folders and also using USB flash drives to store data as well. The third article goes into creating and organizing files using folders. It also explained how to use Windows Backups as well. There are a lot of things that I had already knew from the readings. However, I didn't know that the Ctrl + E shortcut existed to open file explorer, nor did I know that there was actually a built-in function for backups. Though I have not been using backups, it's something that I will certainly have to consider in the near future. As for the shortcuts, it definitely seems useful, but requires a lot of muscle memory or knowledge of what the shortcuts are. However, I'd imagine that a lot of time can be cut down once they are proficient at using shortcuts.


Activity 5:
Activity 5 looks into Geolocation, which uses a large computer database to map out and identify where each IP address is located at on a map. It's interesting to see that IP addresses don't tie directly into a person's actual location, but a generalized area instead called a Geolocation. I am currently using a VPN, and the websites for identifying IP addresses has some fairly interesting things: It states that my IP information is a "Network Sharing Device", alongside the IPv6 saying "Not detected". As for the geolocation website, it's fairly detailed in where that IP address resides, which is quite intriging. From the article, it states that geolocation accuracy has improved over the years, which makes me somewhat concerned, as one of the information that people must give is their IP address if they wanted to connect anywhere at all. 


Activity 6:
Activity 6 looked into using traceroute (or tracert) to see where and how the packets bounce between each IP nodes. This can be useful to identify where in the step of transferring the data is going wrong if there's any problems. I cannot write much about this, as I cannot get tracert to work. Both the command and the website said "General failure." and "Uh Oh, Something Broke! Error Getting Results" respectively. However, for some odd reason, I tried doing a tracert 192.168.0.1, and the first hop worked fine to 10.11.0.1. However, the consequent hops didn't work at all, stating "Request timed out." Though I can see the variety of hops that the packets go through in the howtogeek website, which is very interesting to see.
