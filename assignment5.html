Social Media:
Activity 1:
Activity 1 showed various social media that I both heard and haven't heard about. I knew about Facebook, Google+ (although very little), Twitter, Linkedin, Whatsapp, and Line. However, I didn't know about the others, which makes me wonder how much of the market share they took. I learned about Facebook through my friends and family, as it was a social media giant during that point. Despite that, I haven't used Facebook much besides playing the various games they had. It also makes me wonder about the Facebook integration that various games had and also made me wonder why they included them within their games. I don't know much about Linkedin, however, as I haven't looked into professional jobs, though it's almost with certainty that I would need a Linkedin account regardless, due to how important it is for jobs. 

Activity 3:
The Honeycomb model is a set of building blocks that most social media abides by. It includes Identity, Presence, Relationships, Reputation, Groups, Conversations, and Sharing. I found the Reputation portion of the honeycomb model somewhat ironic. The main reason I found it ironic was the rather negative sentiment found throughout various websites, such as Twitter, YouTube and whatnot. For YouTube, one of the main things people disliked was the rampant abuse of copyright claims, as people could impersonate companies (or if they are the legitimate copyright owner) and falsely copyright videos. However, I'd imagine that all of this somewhat pales in comparison to the actual functions of their respective websites, considering that there's really no other place that is as big as Twitter or YouTube and has the same functionalities. In terms of the other parts of the honeycomb model, there's nothing else that they're lacking. 

Communications:
Activity 5:
Activity 5 talks about piracy and how it's against the laws. The main infraction of peer-to-peer file sharing is violating the copyright law. I have heard about youtube-dl being taken down at one point, which was most likely related to downloading copyrighted videos. I've also heard about the various ways that producers try to prevent copy distributions, such as the anti-piracy measures in video games, imposing restrictions on theatre videos (such as only being able to operate at a specific time, some slight color distortion on some parts of the frames that are unique to that specific theatre, etc...), and whatnot. There are many interesting ways to combat piracy, which makes sense, as they're there to protect the copyright owner's copyrights and get their fair share of the money. One interesting thing that I had recently stumbled upon was that with the Discord and Spotify integration, if you had your microphone "active" long enough and Spotify was playing at the time, then Discord detects that and tells Spotify to pause your play track. This was fairly interesting to me because of how Discord had figured out how to prevent illegal music streaming to other people.
