Activity 1:
Activity 1 shows the basics of email, and shows how different they are in comparison to other methods of messaging. Before I read this, I thought that emails were somewhat "primitive" compared to what we have now (such as other ways to message, like facebook, skype, discord, etc...). However, I neglected the abundance of features that emails had, such as sending the same email to multiple recipients, attaching attachments, email sorting, contact information, and even creating and sharing calendars (though that might be Gmail specific). It also went over the standard way to format a professional email, which I had severely neglected as well. My current email at the moment is set to the default settings, so it's very messy and littered with promotional emails, so I will look further into emails and try to customize my emails in the near future.

Activity 3:
One of the things that I haven't realized until now is that emails could also be an application. Since I don't use emails extensively, I use most of my emails on a website, which is typically hosted by the email provider (Gmail). Mozilla Thunderbird is very similar to a web browser, which probably does make sense if it's a branch off of Firefox. It's interesting to see how different it is from Gmail, as I can right click and do a lot more things, such as opening it in a new window, organizing the mail, tagging the mail, and more. What's even more interesting is that it also saw which mail I had already read directly from Gmail as well. Unfortunately, I didn't have any contacts from Gmail (as I rarely use emails extensively in the first place), so I couldn't make use of the contacts. Though it's certainly something that I should use in the future. Alongside that, it seems like I can get multiple emails and use all of it within the program as well, which is very convenient. I heard from one of my friends that there was a way to forward messages from email accounts to another, but I haven't looked into that yet, but this would probably be more convenient for me. Alongside that, it's also interesting to see that there's different protocols for email, such as SMTP, POP3, and IMAP. I never would have thought that emails would have different protocols. 

Activity 4:
Email spoofing has been one of the things that I have heard, but never knew how it worked. The resources given in Activity 4 was slightly confusing, as there were no examples of telling what was exactly "spoofed" in terms of where it's sent from. I checked one of my emails and it has certainly passed verification according to the website, but I don't exactly know what entails. I was able to show headings on Mozilla Thunderbird. However, I still don't know a surefire way to tell whether or not it's legitimate or not without using Google's website.
