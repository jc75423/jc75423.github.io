Activity 1:
Activity 1 talks about web browsers and demonstrates several basic functions of using the Web as well. The article delved into Hyperlinks, URLs, Emails, Browser Plug-ins, and URL shorteners. It was interesting to see that the article put some attention into the deprecated Adobe flash player, despite it being risky due to the lack of updates and support. 

Activity 2 - 5:
The activities looked into comparing and seeing the differences between each of the browsers. This included Brave, Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Opera browsers. Though all browsers functionally work the same (in terms of connecting to the Web), each of them offers something unique to differentiate between them and the rest of the browsers. For instance, Opera and Brave boasts an built-in ad block, though that could also be said the same for others through extensions/addons. One browser that I found interesting was Firefox, which had numerous options to enable/disable, and held a separate window for both their bookmarks (which can be added with a description too) and history. Another thing that I had found interesting was how most of the browsers had universal key binds (for example, Ctrl + W to close the current tabs). One thing that I had found interesting is that the majority of the browsers listed had things to go alongside it, such as a free VPN, ad blocking, crypto wallet, account/device sharing, messaging app, or even a reward system. Though they are something nice to have, they're all not required to have to browse on the internet. For instance, I would certainly be wary of letting a browser hold any information of my passwords or emails, much less something that has currency value. 

Activity 6:
Activity 6 looked at the compatibility of the various browsers with HTML and HTML5. It was interesting, but surprising that Chrome remained at the top of the "compatibility" chart with HTML5. What's even more surprising is that Firefox was one of the lower ends of the compatibility chart as well, next to Safari. However, I'd imagine that this isn't too much of a big issue, since they're off within the range of 50ish, instead of something even greater. It was also interesting how Edge was listed as the only browser that had 100% functionality with HTML5.
